## 🐾 Who We Are

**Gentle as cat's paws, reliable as a cat's appetite.**

We're a logistics technology company dedicated to making storage, delivery, and transformation of goods as seamless as possible—whether you're shipping to the next city, a remote island, or to the far edge of the Solar System.

Our mission is simple:

> **Logistics for anyone, anywhere, anyhow.**

Whether you're a small start-up needing warehouse integration or a moon base requesting cat-approved cargo drops—we've got you covered.

## 🧭 Ground truths

- 🐳 Delivery of a Kubernetes container to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean? No problem.  
- 🍳 Breakfast of champions? Mostly tuna. Sometimes server logs.  
- 🐈 Internal mascot: **Captain Whiskers**, our SAD MF-certified space navigator.  
- 🚀 Want to deliver something to the edge of the Solar System? We might have a space cat squad just for that (subject to availability).

## 🧪 Experimental Routes

We’re not afraid to explore the impossible. Some of our more… *ambitious* logistical experiments:

- Quantum-entangled inventory tracking—because Schrödinger’s crate can be both lost and delivered... until you look at it.  
- Lunar warehousing with solar-powered forklifts and high-jump gravity catapults.  
- Mars-to-Earth return deliveries (ETA: 3–9 months, depending on alignment and bureaucracy).  
- Cat-operated wormhole hubs for same-millisecond delivery across galaxies.  
- Autonomous drone fleets powered by zero-point tuna energy.

If you think these are just jokes... wait until you see our R&D budget.
